# My Personal Portfolio 

 ## Description

 This was my first built from-scratch webpage. I was tasked with created a website that had a functional navbar that takes the user to specific sections of the webpage;
  Each section is to be as follows: 
   - About: Has a picture of me and a short paragraph about me. 
   - Portfolio: Has 4 pictures of my work and links to each of those deployed works. The first item is larger than the other three. 
   - Contact: Has information on how to contact me.

The website should also be responsice to adapt to the viewport of the device that is is viewed on. 


## Usage 

- Open a broswer. Navigate to [https://cplumlee72.github.io/Module-2-Challenge/](https://cplumlee72.github.io/Module-2-Challenge/)

- Click on links in the navbar in order to jump to specific sections on the page. 

- Click on images of the deployed applications in the Portfolio section in order to open a new tab to the applications. 

- Click on the links in the Contact Section to send me an e-mail or open a new tab to my Github page.
